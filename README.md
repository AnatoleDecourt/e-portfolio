This document explain the purpose of this project, how to use it and how to get involved in it.


## e-portfolio

An **e-portfolio** is the web-equivalent of a curriculum vitea. It presents who you are, what you do, how you want to evolve... It's as simple as that. This one have been designed with HTML and CSS.


## Website

As this project is a simple HTML website, there is not a lot to know before using it. Just click on links, look at beutifully presented pages, and find the informations you are looking for.


## Returns / help

This is my very first HTML + CSS project. I tried ly best to make my website and my code as clean as possible, but I know some things are a bit odd / shouldn't have been done like they've been. Feel free to contribute and let me know if you spot any issue or if you have any hearth attack looking at the code.
